            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>Cimex was created to be a project management application. The goal was to create an application that would allow users to track and manage their projects, as well as to connect and collaborate with others. I had been learning the MERN stack and was itching to put into practice some of the concepts I had learned. Building a bug tracker allowed me not only to create a useful app but helped me familiarize myself with a tool I would be using as a developer.</p>

            <h3>Features</h3>
            <p>Cimex allows registered users to create, update and share projects, track and manage issues on those projects, as well as to collaborate with others by creating teams. Issues can be assigned to any user with whom the project is shared while custom middleware will prevent unauthorized users from accessing your projects. A simple e-mail search allows other users to be added to your contacts.</p>

            <h3>Technology Highlights</h3>
            <p>Being a project management application, Cimex not only requires a large number of CRUD operations to be performed on virtually every page, but proper user authentication and authorization needs to be ensured as well. Each API I had written using Nodeâ€™s Express Framework to handle these operations was tested using Postman. Once I knew my APIs were working as intended, I moved onto integrating the responses into the client side. Redux was a great middleman for storing as state the data received from the database and I used React to access that and create a smooth interface for the user.</p>
