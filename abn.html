            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>In my prior role as an auditor, as part of our risk assessment process, we would request a data dump of suppliers and customers from our client’s database. We would then verify whether the Australian Business Number (ABN) listed for each supplier / customer was valid. While our in-house data analytics scripts were still being written, it was at each auditor’s discretion in how they accomplished this. I created a Python algorithm to automate this process. Since then, I’ve added a web interface and have added an API call to the Australian Business Register to also obtain the entity name and business name(s) associated with the ABN.</p>

        <div class="details details--2">
            <h3>Features</h3>
            <p>ABN Validator allows users to upload a spreadsheet containing ABNs. My algorithm will then scan through each ABN and check whether the ABN is valid. If valid, a call will be made to the Australian Business Register API to obtain the entity name and business name(s) for that ABN. The user will be redirected to a page containing a downloadable file. This file will be an updated spreadsheet with extra columns / rows containing the results.</p>

            <h3>Technology Highlights</h3>
            <p>Since I was going to be working with data dumps, I needed to choose a library with fast spreadsheet read and update abilities. I chose Python’s pandas data analytics library for its easy to use structures and high performance. As I had written my algorithm in Python, I decided to keep going down the Python route and round out my application with Python’s Django Framework. Django’s built-in templating was the perfect tool for passing my Python-written back end data to be rendered on the client side. </p>
